                        <h2 class="major">Spanish Certification</h2>
                        <p>I am a certified Spanish medical interpreter. I worked for Access 2 Interpreters in Columbus from Autumn of 2014 to Autumn of 2015. I was responsible for taking my own appointments for the following day, being on call for emergencies
                            and over night assignments, and interpreting in high stress situations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Working this job caused me to develop my communicational and interpersonal skills. Working in high stress, life or death situations allowed me to develop critical thinking skills and to work and communicate under pressure.


                        </p>

                        <p>

                            While this doesn't directly attribute to programming and software development, it does help me to work on a team in stressful situations better. I also hope to use this experience to work in an international setting.

                        <p>
                            From February till August I worked at The Columbus Collaboratory. The Collaboratory is a startup focused on providing quick insight data analytics. They provide advanced analytics and cyber security to their member companies. They hope to draw IT talent
                            to the Columbus Ohio region and turn Columbus into a nationally recognized technology leader.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            While at the Collaboratory I was an intern in the Data Analytics division. I was in charge of finding innovative and programmatical ways of interacting with, accessing, and storing public data to augment our member companies’ private data. Later I completed
                            a project of benchmarking several cognitive resources to understand how they work in standard and fringe use cases.


                        </p>

                        <p>

                            The most important part of my internship, in my opinion, was having the freedom to choose projects to work on as long as they had some meaningful result. This allowed me to get help from several coworkers and grow as a programmer. While several projects
                            began just to die the next day, I still learned more about programming and thinking like an engineer than I have in class. I’m extremely grateful for this internship. It has helped guide me into what I want to do and where
                            I want to go. The majority of its benefit is intangible, but manifested in my new found ability to problem solve and learn on my own. I will always be grateful to the Collaboratory for this opportunity.

                            <p>I am certified competent to the A2 level of German. This does not mean fluency, but I am competent in basic situations and in most situations arising from travel. This experience helped me to navigate foreign situations on
                                my own as I lived in Austria learning German. I will use it in navigating international situations with my future work.

                            <p>During my time at The Columbus Collaboratory I worked on a Twitter scraper using opensource technologies. It was built using node js. It is currently on my Github to view. However, I still plan to do more work on it. I hope
                                to use express js to create a GUI for the scraper and also clean up the code to be more professional.

                            <p>In keeping with the big data and analytics internship, I used R to analyze a 250mb file of Twitter data pertaining to Victoria's Secret. Using R while trying to validate my data, I was able to find redundant data that was gathered
                                more than once.
